## 🧠 Stillbit AI Modules — Open Source Layer

Stillbit's intelligence is composed of predictive and structural scanning functions — each one quietly monitoring the chain for signs of weakness, deviation, or collapse.  
Below are the core logic modules driving the system.

### ⚙️ StabilityCore — Real-Time Structural Monitoring

```javascript
function stabilityCore(assetData) {
  const stabilityIndex = assetData.priceFluctuation * Math.pow(assetData.marketDepth, 0.5);
  const stabilityThreshold = 3000;

  return stabilityIndex > stabilityThreshold
    ? 'Alert: Asset Instability Detected'
    : 'Asset Stable';
}
```
#### 🧠 Purpose: Measures short-term instability potential by combining live price fluctuations with market depth.
#### Why it matters: Shallow liquidity paired with strong volatility creates cracks in structure — this module flags them before they widen.

### 🧠 RiskMinder — Predictive Stability Forecasting

```javascript
function riskMinder(assetData) {
  const volatilityImpact = Math.log(assetData.priceVolatility + 1) * assetData.marketMomentum;
  const stabilityFactor = assetData.stabilityScore / assetData.marketRisk;
  const forecastRisk = volatilityImpact * stabilityFactor;

  return forecastRisk > 0.8
    ? 'Alert: Risk of Instability Forecasted'
    : 'Asset Stability Likely';
}
```
#### 🔮 Purpose: Forecasts near-future risk based on how reactive the asset is to volatility and overall market momentum.
#### Why it matters: This is forward-looking — detecting when the future starts to lean toward structural breakdown.

### 🧩 SecureFlow — Live Health Indexing

```javascript
function secureFlow(assetData) {
  const assetHealthIndex = (assetData.price * assetData.demandFactor) / assetData.priceVolatility;
  const healthThreshold = 0.5;

  return assetHealthIndex < healthThreshold
    ? 'Alert: Asset Health Below Acceptable Level'
    : 'Asset Health Stable';
}
```
#### 🩺 Purpose: Assesses token vitality by balancing demand, price strength, and volatility levels.
#### Why it matters: This function highlights when a token’s internal flow weakens — even if the surface still looks strong.

### 🪨 EndureScan — Historical Strength Analysis

```javascript
function endureScan(assetData) {
  const enduranceFactor = Math.pow(assetData.priceChange, 2) * assetData.assetAge;
  const riskThreshold = 100;

  return enduranceFactor < riskThreshold
    ? 'Alert: Asset Endurance Low'
    : 'Asset Endurance Sufficient';
}
```
#### 📉 Purpose: Evaluates if an asset has the historical strength to endure future stress or downcycles.
#### Why it matters: Not every spike is built to last. This tool distinguishes temporary hype from real staying power.

### 🔮 LongTermGuard — Extended Forecast Layer

```javascript
function longTermGuard(assetData) {
  const longTermRisk = (assetData.price * assetData.marketMomentum) / Math.sqrt(assetData.volatility);

  return longTermRisk > 2
    ? 'Alert: Long-Term Instability Predicted'
    : 'Long-Term Stability Assured';
}
```
#### 📊 Purpose: Predicts how a token may behave under macro pressure over time.
#### Why it matters: This isn’t noise. It’s a long-wave signal that lets you act before the storm builds.

## 🧩 Final Signal

Stillbit doesn’t chase noise — it waits for alignment.  
In the quiet between spikes, it listens. In the cracks, it calculates.

When the chain shifts, Stillbit already knows.

Move with structure. Think with clarity.  
Let the signal be still.
