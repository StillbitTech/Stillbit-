## 🌠 Key Features

🕳️ **DarkTrack**  
Scans for fragmented or obfuscated transactions that may signal laundering, proxy routing, or hidden flows across wallets.

📡 **SignalLight**  
Monitors token activity to detect:
- Sudden volume bursts  
- Liquidity reallocation  
- Coordinated manipulation patterns

⚠️ **RiskAlert**  
Delivers real-time warnings when smart contracts exhibit suspicious behaviors — from stealth mints to LP unlocks and dev withdrawals.

📊 **DataPulse**  
Analyzes live market flow and sentiment overlays to highlight:
- Trend spikes  
- Coordinated sell-offs  
- High-risk formation zones

## 🗺️ AuroraTrace — Signal Roadmap

AuroraTrace evolves across phases — from detection to foresight.  
Each stage expands the system’s reach, clarity, and intelligence.

### ✅ Phase 1: MVP (Live)

The core tracing engine has been activated — **Aurora’s light pierces the veil**.

- 🌌 **DarkTrack** — Covert transaction surveillance
- 📡 **SignalLight** — Real-time anomaly detection
- 🛡 **RiskAlert** — Instant flags for suspicious behavior
- 🔦 **DataPulse** — Continuous monitoring of market flow
- 🔗 **Discord-Synced Access Key** — Role-based feature unlocks via $AURA holdings
- 💠 **$AURA Token Integration** — Powering layered access and advanced tools  
📅 *Deployed: Q3 2025*

### 🟣 Phase 2: Pulse Expansion (Active)

The system evolves — deeper insights, broader tracking, and more intuitive signals.

- 🌐 **GuardLayer** — Multi-chain expansion across Solana, Base, Arbitrum
- 🔍 **PatternTrace** — Advanced detection of recurring anomaly patterns
- 🧭 **AlertFlow** — Cross-token syncing for smarter alert correlation
- 🧬 **Behavior Matrix** — Identification of subtle transaction intent signals
- 📊 **Role-Synced Dashboards** — UI elements adapt based on your access level  
📅 *In Progress: Q4 2025*

### 🔴 Phase 3: Cognitive Forecasting (Planned)

Aurora becomes predictive — no longer just detecting, but *foretelling*.

- 🛰️ **EchoMap** — Visual mapping of wallet migrations and shadow flows
- ⚠️ **Disruption Predictor** — Predictive risk scoring before anomalies emerge
- 🧠 **Neural Trace Engine** — Foresight powered by deep learning and memory layers
- 💬 **Signal Sentiment Feed** — Fusion of on-chain behavior and social sentiment
- 🌉 **ChainBridge Scanner** — Cross-chain syncing of risk patterns  
📅 *Scheduled: Q1 2026*

**AuroraTrace** is not static — it's a growing, learning sentinel.  
As threats evolve, so does the signal.

## 📂GitHub Access

Each AuroraTrace module is engineered to scan blockchain behavior in real time — identifying risks, tracing hidden flows, and decoding market patterns before they become threats.

### 🕳️ DarkTrack — Hidden Transaction Tracer

**Goal:**  
Identify transaction paths that are fragmented, obfuscated, or routed through proxy wallets to mask intent.

```python
def dark_track(tx_path):
    if len(tx_path) > 5 and tx_path.count('unknown_wallet') >= 2:
        return "Suspicious Movement Detected"
    elif len(tx_path) > 3:
        return "Obscured Transaction Trail"
    else:
        return "Normal Flow"
```
#### Interpretation:
Long and complex chains with unknown wallets may indicate laundering, relays, or stealth routing attempts.

### 📡 SignalLight — Anomaly Signal Detector
#### Goal: Detect short-term anomalies such as micro pumps, liquidity distortions, and artificial transaction surges.

```javascript
function signalLight(volumeChange, liquidityShift, txSpike) {
  if (volumeChange > 150 && liquidityShift < 10 && txSpike > 60) {
    return "High Anomaly Risk";
  } else if (volumeChange > 80) {
    return "Moderate Signal Detected";
  } else {
    return "Normal Activity";
  }
}
```
####  Interpretation: Sharp volume spikes with low liquidity and high transaction count often suggest botnet activity or pump attempts.

### ⚠️ RiskAlert — Irregularity Notifier
#### Goal: Trigger real-time alerts when a token exhibits behavior consistent with high-risk patterns.

```python
def risk_alert(tx_density, token_age_days, recent_alerts):
    if tx_density > 300 and token_age_days < 5 and recent_alerts >= 2:
        return "Immediate Risk Alert"
    elif tx_density > 150:
        return "Watchlist"
    else:
        return "Stable"
```
#### Interpretation: Young tokens with intense transaction volume and previous alert history are strong scam/rugpull candidates.

### 📊 DataPulse — Market Flow Tracker
#### Goal: Analyze evolving price and wallet inflow data to highlight sudden shifts in market behavior.

```javascript
function dataPulse(priceDelta, walletInflow, timeframeMinutes) {
  const speed = walletInflow / timeframeMinutes;
  if (priceDelta > 20 && speed > 5) {
    return "Trend Spike Detected";
  } else if (priceDelta < -15) {
    return "Negative Trend Shift";
  } else {
    return "Steady Market Pulse";
  }
}
```
#### Interpretation: Price increases with rapid inflows can mark bullish spikes, while sharp drops despite inflows may signal coordinated exits or traps.
