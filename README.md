## 🛣 Roadmap

Stillbit evolves through three strategic phases — from foundational stability tools to advanced predictive intelligence. Below is the development timeline:

### 🧊 Phase 1: Core Launch *(✅ Completed)*  
*The foundation of long-term asset resilience is live.*

- **StabilityCore** — Real-time monitoring of token integrity  
- **RiskMinder** — Predictive alerts based on volatility history  
- **SecureFlow** — Continuous asset health diagnostics  
- **EndureScan** — Real-time vulnerability assessments  
- **Discord-Based Access Key** — Role sync via verified wallet  
- **$STILL Token Integration** — Unlocks tiered access to features  
- 📅 **Deployed in Q3 2025**

### 🟦 Phase 2: Signal Expansion *(🚧 In Progress)*  
*From passive monitoring to intelligent, adaptive insight.*

- **LongTermGuard** — Deep AI-driven token life cycle analysis  
- **SecurePredict** — Long-term market risk forecasting  
- **AdaptiveRisk** — Behavior-reactive AI risk layer  
- **MarketSync** — Multi-token scanning and synchronized insights  
- **Role-Based UI Expansion** — Features gated by token tier  
- 📅 **Expected Q3–Q4 2025**

### 🟪 Phase 3: Predictive Layer *(🧠 Planned)*  
*The system begins to think ahead — modeling the future, not just tracking the present.*

- **Flashloan Interference Map** — Real-time flashloan activity radar  
- **AI Forecast Engine** — Predictive risk scores trained on evolving token data  
- **Anomaly Pulse Layer** — Detects pre-volatility instability signals  
- **Cross-Chain Stability Mapping** — Expanding beyond Solana  
- 📅 **Planned Q1 2026**

## 🧠 Open Source Functions

Stillbit’s intelligence is powered by a set of specialized AI-driven functions that analyze token stability, liquidity dynamics, and structural endurance. Below are the core modules integrated into the system:

### ⚙️ StabilityCore — Real-Time Structural Monitoring

```js
function stabilityCore(assetData) {
  const stabilityIndex = assetData.priceFluctuation * Math.pow(assetData.marketDepth, 0.5);
  const stabilityThreshold = 3000;

  return stabilityIndex > stabilityThreshold
    ? 'Alert: Asset Instability Detected'
    : 'Asset Stable';
}
```
#### Purpose:
Measures an asset’s short-term instability potential by combining live price fluctuations with current liquidity depth.
High fluctuations on shallow depth? That’s where structural cracks begin to show — and Stillbit flags them before they widen.

### 🧠 RiskMinder — Predictive Stability Forecasting

```js
function riskMinder(assetData) {
  const volatilityImpact = Math.log(assetData.priceVolatility + 1) * assetData.marketMomentum;
  const stabilityFactor = assetData.stabilityScore / assetData.marketRisk;
  const forecastRisk = volatilityImpact * stabilityFactor;

  return forecastRisk > 0.8
    ? 'Alert: Risk of Instability Forecasted'
    : 'Asset Stability Likely';
}
```
#### Purpose:
Projects near-future risk exposure based on how reactive a token is to volatility and momentum.
This function isn’t about what is happening — it’s about what could happen next.

### 🧩 SecureFlow — Live Health Indexing

```js
function secureFlow(assetData) {
  const assetHealthIndex = (assetData.price * assetData.demandFactor) / assetData.priceVolatility;
  const healthThreshold = 0.5;

  return assetHealthIndex < healthThreshold
    ? 'Alert: Asset Health Below Acceptable Level'
    : 'Asset Health Stable';
}
```
#### Purpose:
Gauges an asset’s internal health by weighing price strength and organic demand against volatility.
A healthy token flows — this check ensures it’s not limping behind shiny illusions.

### 🪨 EndureScan — Historical Strength Analysis

```js
function endureScan(assetData) {
  const enduranceFactor = Math.pow(assetData.priceChange, 2) * assetData.assetAge;
  const riskThreshold = 100;

  return enduranceFactor < riskThreshold
    ? 'Alert: Asset Endurance Low'
    : 'Asset Endurance Sufficient';
}
```
#### Purpose:
Determines whether an asset has the track record to withstand future stress.
Sudden surges can look strong, but without age and consistency, they fade.

### 🔮 LongTermGuard — Extended Forecast Layer

```js
function longTermGuard(assetData) {
  const longTermRisk = (assetData.price * assetData.marketMomentum) / Math.sqrt(assetData.volatility);

  return longTermRisk > 2
    ? 'Alert: Long-Term Instability Predicted'
    : 'Long-Term Stability Assured';
}
```
#### Purpose:
Projects how a token will behave under slow-building macro pressure.
When this one lights up, it’s not noise — it’s a warning from the future.
